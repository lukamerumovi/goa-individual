    <h1>The falafel</h1>
    <p>Falafel is more than a dish to me; it’s a celebration of texture and contrast. The moment I bite into a falafel ball, the exterior offers a delicate, crackling hush, giving way to a tender, almost velvety interior that holds just enough warmth to remind you it’s freshly fried. There’s a quiet drama in the moment—the way the crust shatters softly and releases a mosaic of flavors: a whisper of cumin, a tang of parsley, a hint of garlic that lingers without shouting. Each bite feels like a small, earthy poem written in notes of chickpea and herb.
What I love most about falafel is how its texture can range from crisp to lush, depending on how it’s prepared. The crust should be crunchy enough to crackle under pressure, yet the inside must be moist enough to yield with a sigh. When I’m lucky, there’s a slight crumbly edge—the kind that dissolves pleasantly on the tongue and invites the next bite. The act of dipping it into tahini or tangy yogurt sauce heightens the experience, turning each bite into a balance between nutty, creamy, and bright lemony citrus.</p>
