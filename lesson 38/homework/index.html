    <h1 style="color: darkblue; text-align: center;" >Mercedes-Benz G-Class</h1>
    <p style="color: green; font-size: 20px;">The G-Class originated in the late 1970s as a rugged, purpose-built off-roader intended for military and expedition use. Early models emphasized go-anywhere capability, mechanical simplicity, and durability. Over time, the vehicle transitioned from a utilitarian workhorse to a luxury SUV, while retaining its distinctive boxy silhouette and exceptional off-road competence. The first prototype debuted in 1979, and the vehicle entered production in 1979â€“1980. Initially, it was offered primarily for military use, but soon gained attention for its off-road prowess and became available for civilian markets.</p>
